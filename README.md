# AI-Powered Chatbot with PyQt6 GUI

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a desktop chatbot application built with Python, leveraging the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for natural language processing. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface created using PyQt6, allowing for seamless interaction with the AI assistant.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive GUI**: Clean and responsive interface built with PyQt6
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for intelligent conversation
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Implements threading to maintain UI responsiveness during API calls
- **Environment Variable Management**: Securely handles API keys using dotenv

## Technical Highlights

- **Frontend**: PyQt6 for creating a desktop GUI application
- **Backend**: Python with OpenAI API integration
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Threading for non-blocking API calls
- **Code Structure**: Modular design with separate frontend and backend components

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming
- GUI development with PyQt6
- API integration (OpenAI)
- Asynchronous programming
